# Who am I: My Top 5 Clifton Talents
### 1. Achiever

Achievers have a constant need for attainment. They have an internal fire burning inside them. It pushes them to do and achieve more. People with strong Achiever talents feel as if every day starts at zero. By the end of the day, they must accomplish something meaningful to feel good about themselves.


### 2. Focus

People with strong Focus talents prioritize and then take action. They set goals that serve as their compass, helping them determine priorities and make alterations when needed to get back on course.


### 3. Activator

People with strong Activator talents are impatient for action. They may concede that analysis has its uses or that debate and discussion can occasionally yield some valuable insights, but deep down they know that only action is real. Once a decision is made, they must act.


### 4. Learner

People with strong Learner talents constantly strive to learn and improve. The process of learning is just as important to them as the knowledge they gain. The steady and deliberate journey from ignorance to competence energizes Learners.


### 5. Relator

Relator talents forms close relationships with people. People with strong Relator talents are drawn to others they already know. They do not necessarily shy away from meeting new people — in fact, they may have other themes that cause them to enjoy the thrill of turning strangers into friends — but they do derive a great deal of pleasure and strength from being around their close friends. A person with strong Relator talents forms close relationships with people.
