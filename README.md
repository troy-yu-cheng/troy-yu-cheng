# Who am I: My Top 5 Clifton Talents
### 1. Achiever

Achievers have a constant need for attainment. They have an internal fire burning inside them. It pushes them to do and achieve more.

**Key Phrases That Stand Out:**

- Reduce plans, processes, or mechanisms into their fundamental parts  
- Methodical approach

- You might not allow many distractions to interrupt your intense thinking when you are working on tasks that match your expertise or pique — that is, arouse or excite — your curiosity; When you pair your instigation with your concentration, you create a momentum that is always aimed at your goal; Channel energy toward what you might accomplish in the coming years
- The person who brings the conversation back to practical or factual matters
- You know you are somehow linked to every human being on the planet. This partially explains why you sense whatever you choose to do or not do affects them just as their choices eventually affect you; walking a tightrope between wanting to be totally independent and knowing you need others to survive

- Bottom line: Activators know they will be judged not by what they say or what they think, but by what they get done. This does not frighten them. It energizes them.
